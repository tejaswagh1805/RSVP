# RSVP DXB Admin

Admin only dashboard for applications, members, events, wall moderation, brand credits, and event door check-in.

## Stack

- React and Vite frontend
- Node.js and Express API
- Neon Postgres persistence through `@neondatabase/serverless`

The server starts with local demonstration data when `DATABASE_URL` is not set. That mode is useful for exploring the dashboard; changes reset when the server restarts. The two local demo accounts are `tejas@rsvpdxb.local` and `admin@rsvpdxb.local`, both with password `demo1234`.

To use Neon, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set `DATABASE_URL` and the names, emails, and unique passwords for both admin accounts, then run the database setup command once. Use passwords of at least 12 characters:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm install
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
```

The development client runs on Vite and proxies `/api` requests to the Express server on port 4000. Production serves the built frontend from Express:

```powershell
npm run build
$env:NODE_ENV = 'production'
npm start
```

Neon setup creates the tables, inserts the prototype demonstration records if those IDs are not already present, and provisions both configured administrators. Admin sessions use an HTTP-only cookie and can be ended from the profile menu; “Switch admin” signs out and returns to the sign-in screen so the second administrator can sign in. Keep `.env` private. Email/WhatsApp delivery, invoice processing, and physical QR camera scanning are not included; RSVP codes can be entered manually at the door.

## Existing members and new registrations

The member application page is available at `/register`. It saves submissions in `applications` as pending review. Passwords are stored as scrypt hashes, never as plaintext. Approving an application creates the member directory row and transfers the password hash. Customer login is not part of this admin dashboard yet.

Import the existing member export after setting up the database:

```powershell
npm run db:import-members -- "C:\Users\Tejas\Downloads\rsvp-applications-2026-10-02.csv"
```

The importer maps `influencer` to Creators, `media` to Media, `tastemaker` to Tastemakers, and `brand` to Private Circle while retaining the original track value. It upserts by email and preserves the CSV profile, platform, follower, contact, tier, points, status, city, and joined fields. To validate a file without writing to Neon, run `node server/import-members.js --dry-run "path-to-file.csv"`.
